# data-visualisation-using-R
This repository contains a comprehensive guide to data visualization in R using

Base R graphics – histograms, bar plots, box plots, scatter plots, pie charts, stripcharts, etc.
	•	Lattice package – multi-panel plots, density plots, conditioned scatter plots, barcharts, and advanced layouts.
	•	ggplot2 package – grammar of graphics approach with layered histograms, density plots, bar charts, boxplots, scatter plots, line plots, themes, facets, and quick plots (qplot).

The tutorial demonstrates visualizations for both categorical and continuous variables, exploring single-variable, two-variable, and group comparisons. It uses classic datasets like chickwts, mtcars, diamonds, LakeHuron, and custom movie ratings data to show practical applications.

Designed for students, researchers, and data professionals, this document serves as a practical resource to master visualization techniques in R, from simple plots to publication-quality graphics.
